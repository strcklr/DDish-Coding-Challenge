# DDish-Coding-Challenge

This repository hosts my attempt at the coding challenge provided by Airborne Athletics.
Here are the user stories for the challenge:
- As a user, I would like to connect a Bluetooth heart rate monitor to a mobile app.
- As a user, I would like to see my heart rate real-time in the app
- As a user, I would like to be able to set my max heart rate and receive an alert when I go over my max.
- As a user, I would like to see my heart rate history over the course of a workout/ session in 10-second increments.
- As a CTO I would like to use a standard heart rate BlueTooth LE protocol.
- As a CTO I would like the codebase to be in Flutter.

I tracked my progress for this challenge on a Trello board here: https://trello.com/b/0BgGUeUO/dr-dish-coding-challenge.
