# heartrateapp

This is a Flutter application that connects to a heart rate monitor over BLE to
track workout sessions as well as alerting the user when their heart rate exceeds
the max they've set.

I don't have access to any iOS devices, so this has only been tested on Android.
Here is a link to a screen recorded demo of the application (with workout heart increments at 2 seconds instead of 10): https://photos.app.goo.gl/m2RUqnNDjNYCKKpN8
